# AI-Project
A project done as part of the Artificial Intelligence module. It involved performing several experiments with a deep network and writing down a theory about the network.
The entire project was written in Latex, while the scripts used for the experiments were written in Python. 
Commits are usually written in Polish, as the entire project had to be in that language.
